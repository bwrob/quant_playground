    "# The Copper-to-Gold Ratio Using the OpenBB SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "The copper-to-gold ratio is known as a leading economic indicator.  It is most commonly paired as a time series with the ten-year US Treasury yield. The notable events are the divergences in directional movement, signaling a fundamental regime change that will unfold over months and years.  Not something to go YOLO into, but a metric to shape a long-term view of global economic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio is defined as dividing the spot price of one ounce of copper by an ounce gold.  How much copper is bought with one ouce of gold.  Sounds simple enough,  divide the price of copper by the price of gold, done.  The OpenBB Platform can make quick work out of this task, really quick.  Let's explore."
